Variables are declared with `var` statements, omitting the initialiser results in a variable's value defaulting to `nil`:

```js
var varName = "A value";
var anotherVar; // nil
```

Once declared, the variables can be accessed and assigned a new value using its name:

```cpp
var aThing = "Hi";
aThing = "Bye";
```
