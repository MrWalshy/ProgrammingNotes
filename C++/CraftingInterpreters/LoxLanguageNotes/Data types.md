## Booleans
Lox has a dedicated Boolean type:

```js
true;
false;
```

## Numbers
Lox has one kind of number, a double-precision floating point. Supported notations include integer and decimal literals:

```js
1234;
12.34;
```

## Strings
Strings are the main data type for textual data:

```cpp
"This is a string";
""; // empty string
"123"; // string, not a number
```

## Nil
This represents *no value*, often called `null` in other languages.
