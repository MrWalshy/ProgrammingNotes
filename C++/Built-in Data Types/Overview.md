C++ stores data in variables, these are labels referring to the part of memory defined by the programmer. Each variable has an associated type defining what values can be held by the variable.

The built-in data types of C++ are divided into two categories:
- **Primitive data types**: Can be used directly by the user to declare variables.
- **Abstract or user-defined data types**: Defined by the user, such as defining a class or structure.
