# The C++ Compilation Model

## Overview

Compiling C++ source code into machine code consists of four processes:

1. Preprocessing the source code
2. Compiling the source code
3. Assembling the compiled file
4. Linking the object code file to create an executable file

## Example - Hello World

First, create a file called `helloworld.cpp` and paste the following code:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

In a terminal, navigate to the folder containing the file and execute the following commands if using `g++` on Windows:

```sh
g++ -o HelloWorld helloworld.cpp
./HelloWorld.exe
```

An explanation of how this occurs is as follows:

1. **Preprocessing**: The C++ preprocessor runs before compilation, it will expand any encountered `#include <file>` directives and replace them with the content of the referenced file.
2. **Compiling**: The expanded source code is then compiled into an assembly language for the platform.
3. **Assembly**: The file generated by the compiler is then converted by the assembler into an object code file.
4. **Linking**: The object code file is linked with the object code files for any library functions to produce an executable file.
