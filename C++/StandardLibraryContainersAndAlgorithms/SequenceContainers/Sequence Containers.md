A **sequence container**, also known as **sequential containers**, are a class of containers where the order of elements is decided by the programmer rather than by the elements values. The STL contains five sequence container classes:

- **Array**:
	- Fixed size
	- Fast random access
	- No addition or deletion operation
- **Vector**:
	- Variable-size array
	- Fast random access
	- Addition and deletion supported
	- Append is fast, inserting at a given position is slow
- **Deque**:
	- Double-ended queue
	- Fast random access
	- Insertion and deletion operations at only the front and back of the queue
- **Forward-list**:
	- Singly linked list
	- Sequential access in the forward direction
	- Insertion and deletion operations are fast
- **List**:
	- Doubly linked list
	- Sequential access in both directions
	- Insertion and deletion operations are fast
