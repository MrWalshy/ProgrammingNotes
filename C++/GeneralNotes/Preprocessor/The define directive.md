The `#define` directive is used to create a preprocessor definition within a source file, they are typically referred to as *macros*.

```cpp
#define DEVELOPMENT_BUILD
```

Some IDEs, like Visual Studio, will offer a way to create preprocessor definitions from the IDE that are applied across every file.
