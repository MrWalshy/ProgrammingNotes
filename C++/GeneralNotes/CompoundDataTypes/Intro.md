A **compound/composite data type** is a data type constructed from fundamental data types.

C++ supports the following compound types:

- Functions
- Arrays
- Pointer types:
	- Pointer to object
	- Pointer to function
- Pointer to member types:
	- Pointer to data member
	- Pointer to member function
- Reference types:
	- L-value references
	- R-value references
- Enumerated types:
	- Unscoped enumerations
	- Scoped enumerations
- Class types:
	- Structs
	- Classes
	- Unions

The following function has the type `void(int, int)`, it is a compound type made up of fundamental types:

```cpp
void foo(int x, int y) {}
```
