The `stack` class is defined in the `<stack>` header file, it implements a LIFO access policy. Elements can only be read or removed from the top, the last inserted element is always on the top.

- `push()`: inserts an element into the stack
- `top()`: accesses the element on top of the stack
- `pop()`: removes the top element of the stack
