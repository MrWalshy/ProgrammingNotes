The `queue` class is defined in the `<queue>` header file, it implements a FIFO access policy where each element is enqueued one after the other; elements inserted before are ahead of elements inserted after. Elements are inserted at the end of the queue and removed at the start.

- `push()`: Inserts an element at the back of the queue
- `front()`: Returns the next element of the queue
- `back()`: Returns the last element of the queue
- `pop()`: Removes the next element of the queue
