The **Standard Template Library** (STL) is a set of data structures and algorithms used to facilitate a developers work and improve efficiency.

STL components are parametric to enable reuse and combination in different ways, it is mainly made of container classes, iterators, and algorithms.

A container stores a collection of some type of elements, the type is usually a template parameter allowing the container to support arbitrary elements.

Iterators are used to traverse a collections elements.

- Iterators are similar to raw pointers, which can also iterate through elements using the increment and decrement operators, or can access a specific element using the dereference operator.

Algorithms are used to perform common operations on elements stored in a container.
