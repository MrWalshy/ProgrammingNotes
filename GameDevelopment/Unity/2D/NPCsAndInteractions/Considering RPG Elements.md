When building an RPG, it is important to plan out the game appropriately. Things to think about include:

- Interactive NPCs
- Non-interactive NPCs
- Enemy characters
- Conversations
- Experience
- Maps and places
- Battles
- Missions
- Backstory
- Supporting characters (team)
- Cutscenes

These are the main elements, but more exist that can be expanded on later.

When architecting the game, it is important to start small and with the core game mechanics and then add content or features over time. Trying to do everything from the beginning is generally not possible and can present significant blockers to the games development.
