A **UI Canvas** is an object which holds all UI elements, they can be manually or automatically added (by adding a UI element) to a scene. All UI elements can be created using the **Hierarchy** **Create** menu.

When a UI canvas is added to a scene, an **EventSystem** object will also be added to the **Hierarchy**; this object is used to detect UI button presses and other UI interactions.

Once a new canvas has been added, it won't appear centred over the camera; this is normal.

Double clicking the canvas object in the Hierarchy will bring the full canvas into view.
