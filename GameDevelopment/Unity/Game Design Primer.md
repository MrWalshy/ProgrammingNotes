It is important to consider the following when designing a game:

- **Concept**: Big-picture idea and design of the game, including genre and play style.
- **Core mechanics**: Playable features or interactions a character can take.
- **Control schemes**: Map of buttons or keys players use to control the game.
- **Story**: Underlying narrative.
- **Art style**: Game's look and feel.
- **Win and lose conditions**: Govern how the game is won or lost.

## Game design documents
There are three main types of design documentation used in a game:

- **Game Design Document**: Contains how the game is played, atmosphere, story, and the experience to create.
- **Technical Design Document**: Focuses on the games technical aspects, including the hardware it will run on, class and program architecture, etc...
- **One-Page**: Used for marketing or promotional situations, offers a snapshot of the game.
